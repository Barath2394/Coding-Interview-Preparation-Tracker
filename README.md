# Coding Interview Preparation Tracker

Welcome to your **ultimate coding interview prep tracker!** This spreadsheet is designed to help you organize and systematically practice important algorithm and data structure problems commonly asked in coding interviews.

---

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Inside?

The sheet covers key topics essential for most tech interviews:

- Arrays  
- Strings  
- Binary Search  
- Recursion  
- Backtracking  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Dynamic Programming (DP)  
- Sliding Window

For each topic, youâ€™ll find **7 carefully curated problems** with difficulty levels and columns to track your progress and notes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Use This?

- Structured roadmap to prepare for coding rounds effectively  
- Balanced mix of easy, medium, and hard problems to build confidence and skill  
- Track solved problems, revisit tough ones, and note down insights  
- Improve problem-solving speed and interview readiness step-by-step

---

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Open the spreadsheet file (Google Sheets or Excel).  
2. Work through problems topic-wise, starting from easy to hard.  
3. Mark problems as solved and add notes or alternative approaches you discover.  
4. Revisit medium and hard problems regularly to reinforce concepts.  
5. Practice explaining solutions aloud or in mock interviews for best results.

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

- Focus on understanding the logic behind each solution, not just memorizing code.  
- Time yourself occasionally to simulate real interview conditions.  
- Pair problem-solving with mock interviews to boost confidence.  
- Stay consistent â€” daily practice beats cramming.
